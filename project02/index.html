        <p>While the insights here may not be particularly surprising, as per the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/">U.S. Department of Labor</a>, as of September 2024, 58% of women are a part of the workforce, whereas 68% of their male counterparts are. This indicates a marked difference from the visualized data, but within this change, we’d like to ask whether gender roles really are a thing of the past, or if there are hints of the present in this dataset we have visualized.</p>

        <p>In this dataset dated between x and y, men clearly take the cake in military and politics while women, those who did work, seemed focused on arts and social welfare.</p>

        <p>Has this changed today? Are all industries equally inviting for women? For the ones which are, are they valued by society in equal terms as the male-dominated ones?</p>

        <p>If not, why?</p>
